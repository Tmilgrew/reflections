you use the repository here when sharing work with others.  Keep it local if you don't

you pull changes manually, rather than automatically, so that each pull makes sense at a logical checkpoint

a fork clones a repository from someon on github.  a clone is when you clone a repository. and a branch is done onto a repository where you might have more than one branch.
